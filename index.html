      <h2>Flight</h2>

      <h3>Toward flight</h3>
      <p>
        On July 27, 1899, the brothers put wing warping to the test by building
        and flying a biplane kite with a 5-foot (1.5 m) wingspan, and a curved
        wing with a 1 foot (0.30 m) chord. When the wings were warped, or
        twisted, the trailing edge that was warped down produced more lift than
        the opposite wing, causing a rolling <strong>motion</strong>. The
        warping was controlled by four lines between kite and crossed sticks
        held by the kite flyer. In return, the kite was under
        <em>lateral control</em>.[36] In 1900 the brothers went to Kitty Hawk,
        North Carolina, to begin their manned gliding experiments. In his reply
        to Wilbur's first letter, Octave Chanute had suggested the mid-Atlantic
        coast for its regular breezes and soft sandy landing surface. Wilbur
        also requested and examined U.S. Weather Bureau data, and decided on
        Kitty Hawk[37][38] after receiving information from the government
        meteorologist stationed there.[39][40] Kitty Hawk, although remote, was
        closer to Dayton than other places Chanute had suggested, including
        California and Florida. The spot also gave them privacy from reporters,
        who had turned the 1896 Chanute experiments at Lake Michigan into
        something of a circus. Chanute visited them in camp each season from
        1901 to 1903 and saw gliding experiments, but not the powered flights.

        The Wrights based the design of their kite and full-size gliders on work
        done in the 1890s by other aviation pioneers. They adopted the basic
        design of the Chanute-Herring biplane hang glider ("double-decker" as
        the Wrights called it), which flew well in the 1896 experiments near
        Chicago, and used aeronautical data on lift that Otto Lilienthal had
        published. The Wrights designed the wings with camber, a curvature of
        the top surface. The brothers did not discover this principle, but took
        advantage of it. The better lift of a cambered surface compared to a
        flat one was first discussed scientifically by Sir George Cayley.
        Lilienthal, whose work the Wrights carefully studied, used cambered
        wings in his gliders, proving in flight the advantage over flat
        surfaces. The wooden uprights between the wings of the Wright glider
        were braced by wires in their own version of Chanute's modified Pratt
        truss, a bridge-building design he used for his biplane glider
        (initially built as a triplane). The Wrights mounted the horizontal
        elevator in front of the wings rather than behind, apparently believing
        this feature would help to avoid, or protect them from, a nosedive and
        crash like the one that killed Lilienthal.[11]: 73 Wilbur incorrectly
        believed a tail was not necessary,[41] and their first two gliders did
        not have one. According to some Wright biographers, Wilbur probably did
        all the gliding until 1902, perhaps to exercise his authority as older
        brother and to protect Orville from harm as he did not want to have to
        explain to their father, Bishop Wright, if Orville got injured.[42]*
        (This airfoil caused severe stability problems; the Wrights modified the
        camber on-site.)

      <h3>1900</h3>

      <p>
        The brothers flew the glider for only a few days in the early autumn of
        1900 at Kitty Hawk. In the first tests, probably on October 3, Wilbur
        was aboard while the glider flew as a kite not far above the ground with
        men below holding tether ropes.[13]:188-8 Most of the kite tests were
        unpiloted, with sandbags or chains and even a local boy as ballast.[44]
        They tested wing-warping using control ropes from the ground. The glider
        was also tested unmanned while suspended from a small homemade tower.
        Wilbur, but not Orville, made about a dozen free glides on only a single
        day, October 20. For those tests the brothers trekked four miles (6 km)
        south to the Kill Devil Hills, a group of sand dunes up to 100 feet (30
        m) high (where they made camp in each of the next three years). Although
        the glider's lift was less than expected, the brothers were encouraged
        because the craft's front elevator worked well and they had no
        accidents. However, the small number of free glides meant they were not
        able to give wing-warping a true test. The pilot lay flat on the lower
        wing, as planned, to reduce aerodynamic drag. As a glide ended, the
        pilot was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through an
        opening in the wing and land on his feet with his arms wrapped over the
        framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered the pilot could
        remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing.
        They made all their flights in that position for the next five years.
